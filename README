needs:
 - vtysh (from quagga package)
 - GraphViz perl module


usage:
 Just run 'vtysh_scanner > some_file.png' to generate the graph.
 You need read-access with vtysh, of course.


optional features:
 If there is a 'info.conf' in your directory, it will be read to
 spice up the graph.  The format of info.conf is whitespace delimited
 fields:
 First field contains an AS number.
 Second field contains a name describing the AS.
 Third field optionally contains a flag for marking a node in the output.

 Example info.conf:
60001  this_is_me
60002  Network_A
60003  Network_B  important
60004  Network_C

 This will add labels to the graph nodes 60001 to 60004 and mark the node 60003.
